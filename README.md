Hey this bot is mean't for typeracer.com and easy to use well kinda of not in a way but it works.

First off you will want to go to cmd or Windows Terminal and go to the place with the requirements.txt and type (pip install -r requirements.txt) This will download everything you will need

Next you just run the python file and it should work!
